**Watcher Echolocator** is a mod for Rain World which adds a golden glow around regions still containing an echo on the Watcher warp map.

<b><ins>Note:</ins> As of Rain World v1.10.2, a system functionally the same as this mod (although visually different) has been added to the base Watcher expansion,
with regions containing an unvisited echo now showing a golden ring around them.</b>
